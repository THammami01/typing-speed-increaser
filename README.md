Note:

- If no custom text is set, the default randomly displayed texts are sourced from the Python [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/).<br/>
This provides a 2-in-1 benefit, allowing users to simultaneously practice typing and learn Python.
- You can change the default texts in `default-texts.json` file with your preferred ones.<br/>
Ensure that the file contains an array of strings, and confirm that there is at least one string within the array.
